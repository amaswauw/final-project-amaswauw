## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Summary Table
```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(head(summary_table))
```

The summary table helps high school students determine their chances of acceptance to specific universities as it highlight average SAT and ACT scores and GPA. The summary table breakdown the various ethic groups that make up the universities student population. From the first six universities displayed, the University of Alabama in Huntsville has the highest avg SAT score of 1314. if a student scored 1100 on the SAT. Then they would be able to determine that their chances of acceptance are greater if they applied to either Alabama A&M University of Alabama State University.

## Avg Summary Table
```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(head(avg_summary_table))
```

## Including Plots

These graphs show the average SAT/ACT, GPA, acceptance rate, and univeristy ranking of all universities in each state. There were six states that were not included in this as there was no data available from those states. These states are Alaska, Hawaii, Nebraska, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico. This chart was intended to show the average academic performances from each state, along with showing how each state ranks compared to others. The less the rank, the better they are.
```{r echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(data = test,
        x = ~State.abbreviation,
        y = ~mean_SAT,
        type = "bar"
) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Mean SAT score for universities in each state",
    xaxis = list(title = "State"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Mean SAT")
  )
plot_ly(data = test,
        x = ~State.abbreviation,
        y = ~mean_ACT,
        type = "bar"
)  %>%
  layout(
    title = "Mean ACT score for universities in each state",
    xaxis = list(title = "State"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Mean ACT")
  )
plot_ly(data = test,
        x = ~State.abbreviation,
        y = ~mean_hs_gpa,
        type = "bar"
)  %>%
  layout(
    title = "Mean High School GPA for universities in each state",
    xaxis = list(title = "State"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Mean High School GPA")
  )
plot_ly(data = test,
        x = ~State.abbreviation,
        y = ~mean_acceptance_rate,
        type = "bar"
)   %>%
  layout(
    title = "Mean Acceptance for universities in each state",
    xaxis = list(title = "State"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Mean Acceptance Rate GPA")
  )
plot_ly(data = test,
        x = ~State.abbreviation,
        y = ~mean_ranking,
        type = "bar"
) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Mean Ranking for universities in each state",
    xaxis = list(title = "State"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Mean Ranking")
  )
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
