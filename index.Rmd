## Introduction
Choosing a college is one of the most complicated and impactful decisions in the lives of almost every teenager. The purpose of our INFO 201 project is to help advise the incoming college freshman class to engage in a reasonable decision making process in selecting suitable colleges for themselves. Students accessing our database will be able to quickly view significant admissions criteria including averages in GPA and standardized test scores to estimate their prospectives in applying to each univeristy. Information on school ranking, acceptance rate, and tution is also provided to aid students in narrowing their search.  

[U.S. Department of Education](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) This data is generated from the U.S. department of education (6806 rows, 1982 columns). It provides information on college statistics in regards to admission criteria for several different US universities.

[American University Data](https://www.kaggle.com/sumithbhongale/american-university-data-ipeds-dataset#IPEDS_data.xlsx) This data is generated from tableau (1534 rows, 145 columns). This dataset provides insight into school ranking, GPA, and standardized test scores of US universities.

[US-News](https://www.kaggle.com/theriley106/university-statistics The data was retrieved from US-News) (311 rows, 39 columns) This dataset compiles a wide range of student statistics to rank univeristies in the dataset.


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(head(summary_table))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(head(avg_summary_table))
```

## Including Plots

This graph shows the average tuition of all the universities in each state. The scatter plot can help advise students to look into universities by state based on tutition price. 
`r chart_one` 

These graphs show the average SAT/ACT, GPA, acceptance rate, and univeristy ranking of all universities in each state. There were six states that were not included in this as there was no data available from those states. These states are Alaska, Hawaii, Nebraska, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico. This chart was intended to show the average academic performances from each state, along with showing how each state ranks compared to others. The less the rank, the better they are.
```{r echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(data = test,
        x = ~State.abbreviation,
        y = ~mean_SAT,
        type = "bar"
) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Mean SAT score for universities in each state",
    xaxis = list(title = "State"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Mean SAT")
  )
plot_ly(data = test,
        x = ~State.abbreviation,
        y = ~mean_ACT,
        type = "bar"
)  %>%
  layout(
    title = "Mean ACT score for universities in each state",
    xaxis = list(title = "State"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Mean ACT")
  )
plot_ly(data = test,
        x = ~State.abbreviation,
        y = ~mean_hs_gpa,
        type = "bar"
)  %>%
  layout(
    title = "Mean High School GPA for universities in each state",
    xaxis = list(title = "State"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Mean High School GPA")
  )
plot_ly(data = test,
        x = ~State.abbreviation,
        y = ~mean_acceptance_rate,
        type = "bar"
)   %>%
  layout(
    title = "Mean Acceptance for universities in each state",
    xaxis = list(title = "State"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Mean Acceptance Rate GPA")
  )
plot_ly(data = test,
        x = ~State.abbreviation,
        y = ~mean_ranking,
        type = "bar"
) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Mean Ranking for universities in each state",
    xaxis = list(title = "State"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Mean Ranking")
  )
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
