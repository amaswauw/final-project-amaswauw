A single page providing an overview of the project -- what major questions are you seeking to answer, 
and what data will you use to answer those questions? You should include some "additional flare" on this landing page, 
such as an image.
(Elizabeth - introduction)
Which schools are easier to get in to?
Which schools cost to most to attend? Which ones cost the least?
What schools rank highest based on student statistics(GPA, ethnicity, SAT, etc)
All three data sources.

Three interactive pages that can be used to explore the data.
(Tuition Data - Andrew)
(Ethnic Diversity - Jo)
Each page should revolve around a specific question you have of your dataset.
Each page should have sufficient interactivity (e.g., Shiny widgets + 1 or more reactive charts) for exploring the question of interest.
Default to Washington data!!! Use UI to get interactivity (based on user input, graph specific results)

Summary takeaways, a page that hones in on at least 3 major takeaways from the project (which should be related to a specific aspect of your analysis).
Summary for each chart! (Andrew - Tuition, Academics - Aman, Ethnicity - Jo)
Feel free to incorporate tables, graphics, or other elements to convey these conclusions.
